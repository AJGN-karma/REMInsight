# REMInsight - API (FastAPI + XGBoost)

This folder contains the backend service for REMInsight:
- FastAPI server that exposes `/health`, `/features`, `/predict`, and `/explain` (optional).
- Runtime model download (no large model files committed to git).
- Minimal, tested inference pipeline.

Follow the repo-level README for deployment steps. See `.env.sample` and Render environment variables section.
